**REST API Plain Java**

_Description:_

This project is a minimalistic REST API built entirely in Java without the use of any external frameworks. 
It serves as a foundational example for creating RESTful web services from scratch. 
The project provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing items and can be used as a starting point for more complex Java-based API developments.
